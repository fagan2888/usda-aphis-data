2.33 (b)(1) ATTENDING WBTERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
(b) Each research facility shallestablish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary carethat include: (1) The availability of appropriate facilities, personnel, equipment, and services to comply with the provisions of this subchapter;
The emergency drug box located in the surgical prep room contained 5 bottles of expired drugs. One bottle of Epinephrine and one bottle of 8.4% Sodium Bicarbonate expired in February 2013, two bottles of Diazepam expired in December 2012, and one bottle of Euthasol expired in November 2012. The presence of expired drugs in the emergency drug box greatly increases the probability of their use on a covered species should a veterinary emergency arise. These expired pharmaceutical drugs may have unpredictable effects or decreased potency which could compromise care provided if used during such an emergency event. Correct by ensuring that all drugs used and maintained by the facility are in-date. Any drugs that have passed their expiration date should be identified as "expired" and segregated from the current in use drug stock until their disposal. Additionally, ensure that alternate (in-date) emergency and euthanasia drugs are available as necessary
Correct by: The licensee immediately removed these drugs from the emergency drug box.
